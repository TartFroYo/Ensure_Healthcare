## Overview

Texas ranks second among U.S. states in the number of uninsured persons, with approximately 659,000 people needing healthcare. Additionally, around 7.9% of the Texas population (roughly two million people) faces communication barriers by speaking English “not well” or “not at all.” The Ensure Healthcare Mobile App addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly interface that connects communities with free clinics and community healthcare centers, complete with operational hours, service details, and demographic profiles.

- **Language Barriers:** Approximately two million Texans face language challenges that hinder effective communication with healthcare providers.

The Ensure App bridges these gaps by providing accurate and accessible healthcare service information to underserved communities.
